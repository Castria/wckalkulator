## What makes **WC Kalkulator** unique ?

When designing the functionality of the plugin, we wanted to obtain software that would be easy to use and **highly configurable** and **suitable for any** type of store. 

The plugin allows **full freedom** to define fields and formulas for calculating the price. 
Some of fields are not used in formulas, but you can use it to get informations from Customer (for example: text, date, date range, color, dropdown, etc.)

The plugin is designed to work with multisite mode. We encourage you to contact us and request new features.
