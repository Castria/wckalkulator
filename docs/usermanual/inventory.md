# Stock Management / Inventory

WC Kalkulator v1.3.4 brings support for stock management and stock quantity reduction. This feature is available for single and variable products.
The idea is to reduce a stock quantity by custom value, which is ``Quantity x Multiplier``.

``Multiplier`` is what you can set in Fieldset's Settings. This value can be a numer or math formula. You can use all available fields, operators and functions.

**Product must have stock management enabled in product option**

## Video Tutorial

In this video I show how to reduce stock quantity by field's value. Stock quantity is reduced by 90 pieces, because field value is 45 and quantity is 2.
